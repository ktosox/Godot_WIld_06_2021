planetDescription = "Madriu was a planet is a planet with great, lively jungles all around the globe. If not for murderours fauna and possibly flora it would be a top touristic spot. But instead it became a planet with a well funded and well hidden research facility, doing experimnets on local plants and animals.

That is until the place became abandoned. According to the rumors no researchers made it out alive. But also the same rumors speculate there might a hefty cache of data placed withtin the facility. This might be our best bet at getting the decipher key to the map."
missionDescription = "The plan is simple, as our sensors managed to find this \"well hidden\" facility, we will land near it. Get inside through probably locked and armed with a defense system building holding servers and data banks hefty with information. We download what looks like decypher key and get out.

And of course we try not to be eaten by plants and crazed bugs along the way."
